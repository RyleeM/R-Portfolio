    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>A young software enthusiast ready to conquer whatever theworld has to offer. Went to high school in Moi High School(Embu). Pursued DBIT in Strathmore University for two years and did my CBA at Savanna Informatics (Ngong rd). I chose to do software engineering because I enjoy problem solving â€“ both on a micro and macro scale. Programming involves copious amounts of both. Figuring out the most efficient way to implement a feature or tracking down a bug in existing code are examples of small-scale problems that programmers solve. In short, I'm always  up for a challenge!</p>
